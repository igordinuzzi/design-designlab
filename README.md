# Designlab

Engaging with Designlab as a senior communication designer presented a unique and enriching opportunity to contribute significantly to the educational journey of aspiring UX designers. Designlab, known for its intensive UX Bootcamp, aims to equip students with the essential skills and knowledge to excel in the user experience design field. My role in this endeavor involved the creation of instructional videos, utilizing my expertise in After Effects, motion graphics, and post-production to craft engaging and educational content.

### My Role

As the senior communication designer, I was responsible for designing and animating more than 30 videos, focusing on critical UX concepts. My tasks encompassed everything from initial concept development to the final stages of animation and post-production. The goal was to create content that not only informed but also engaged students, making complex UX principles accessible and understandable. Topics covered included empathy interviews, user personas, user flows, task flows, prototyping, and several Figma tutorial videos. My role required a blend of technical skill in motion graphics and a deep understanding of UX principles to effectively communicate these concepts through video.

### Design Process

My approach to creating these instructional videos involved several key stages:

1. **Content Development:** I started by working closely with instructional designers and subject matter experts to outline the content of each video. This collaboration was crucial to ensure that the videos accurately represented UX concepts and were aligned with the curriculum's learning objectives.

2. **Storyboarding and Scripting:** For each video, I developed storyboards and scripts, laying out the visual and narrative flow. This step was essential for planning how best to communicate complex information in an engaging and accessible manner.

3. **Design and Animation:** With the storyboard and script as my guide, I then moved on to the design and animation phase. Using After Effects, I created motion graphics that brought the content to life, carefully considering pacing, visual hierarchy, and animation techniques to enhance understanding and retention of the material.

4. **Voiceover and Sound Design:** To complement the visuals, I incorporated voiceovers and sound design, selecting tones and voices that would resonate with the audience and support the overall learning experience.

5. **Post-Production:** The final stage involved post-production work, where I fine-tuned the videos, adjusting colors, ensuring audio clarity, and polishing animations to ensure a professional finish.

6. **Feedback and Iteration:** Throughout the process, I engaged in rounds of feedback with the instructional design team and conducted tests with a sample of the target audience. This iterative process allowed me to refine the videos, ensuring they were both informative and engaging.

7. **Delivery and Evaluation:** Once finalized, the videos were integrated into the UX Bootcamp curriculum. I also participated in the evaluation of their impact, assessing student engagement and comprehension to inform future content development.

Creating instructional videos for Designlab's UX Bootcamp was a deeply rewarding experience that allowed me to blend my skills in motion graphics and communication design with my passion for education. By designing content that was both visually appealing and pedagogically sound, I aimed to enhance the learning experience for students, making complex UX concepts accessible and engaging. This project was not just about creating educational materials; it was about empowering the next generation of UX designers with the knowledge and skills they need to succeed.
